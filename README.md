Hello! Welcome to the GitHub page for my 2021 paper, "Trust in Government and Lockdown Compliance in Sub-Saharan Africa." My name is Charles McMurry and I wrote this paper during my senior year at UC Berkeley as my senior thesis for the economics major. I hope you find this paper fascinating and informative. Please feel free to send me any questions or comments you have about it at charlesmcmurry@berkeley.edu!

In this GitHub page, you'll find these folders:
  1. Code - R scripts I used to perform this analysis
  2. Documents - codebooks and other information on the datasets I used
  3. Drafts - various drafts of this paper 
  4. Outputs - data visualizations I created 
  5. Papers - economic literature that informed this investigation
  6. Inputs - datasets I used to perform this analysis
  
You should be able to reproduce the results of my analysis as follows:
  1. Download the Inputs folder and the Code folder
  2. Open "master_script.R" (found in the Code folder) using RStudio. Under "3 - Set Directory Paths", change these variables as follows:
  
    i. "code_path" should be the filepath of the Code folder you downloaded (as a string)
    
    ii. "input_path" should be the filepath of the Inputs folder you downloaded (as a string)
    
    iii. "output_path" should be the filepath of where you would like the outputs of this code to be saved (as a string)
